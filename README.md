# Analyzing the Impact of Recession on Automobile Sales

This project analyzes historical automobile sales data to uncover how recessions have affected sales trends, pricing, and consumer behavior over time. As a data scientist at **XYZAutomotives**, the goal was to generate clear insights to help the company make better strategic decisions.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Features & Analysis

### Part 1: Data Visualizations

Using **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, the project includes:

- **Yearly Sales Trends**
  - Line charts showing how automobile sales fluctuated year over year.
  - Annotated recession periods for context.
- **Vehicle Type Comparisons**

  - Multiple plots comparing sales trends for different vehicle categories (Superminicar, Smallfamilycar, Mediumfamilycar, Executivecar, Sports).
  - Clear evidence of which vehicle types were more resilient to economic downturns.

- **Recession vs Non-Recession Analysis**
  - Bar plots comparing sales volumes during recession and non-recession periods.
  - Pie charts of advertising expenditure split by recession status and vehicle type.
- **Economic Factors & Correlation**

  - Scatter plots showing the relationship between:
    - Average vehicle price and sales volume.
    - Consumer confidence and sales during recessions.
  - GDP trends over time during recession and non-recession periods.
  - Bubble plot showing the impact of seasonality on monthly sales.

- **Unemployment Impact**
  - Line plots analyzing how unemployment rates influenced vehicle sales for each category.

## Part 2: Interactive Dashboard

I also created a **dashboard using Dash and Plotly** to provide interactive exploration:

âœ… **Recession Report Graphs**

- Visualize sales, GDP, consumer confidence, and advertising expenditure filtered for recession periods.

âœ… **Yearly Report Graphs**

- Compare yearly trends across all variables.
- Dropdown selectors allow filtering by year and vehicle type.

This dashboard helps stakeholders drill down into the data without generating separate plots.
